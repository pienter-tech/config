# Review Changes

Perform a practical review focused on high-impact issues first.

## Inputs to inspect

- `git log --oneline -10 --graph --decorate`
- `git status --porcelain`
- `git diff --cached --stat`
- `git diff --stat`
- `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --name-only`

## Review priorities

1. Correctness and regressions
2. Security and secret exposure
3. Performance risks
4. Maintainability and architecture fit
5. Testing and documentation gaps

## Output format

Provide findings first, ordered by severity:
- Critical
- Major
- Minor

For each finding, include:
- Why it matters
- Concrete fix guidance
- File reference

If no issues are found, state that explicitly and note residual risks.
